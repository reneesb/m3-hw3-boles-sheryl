  <h2>About the Queen</h2>
  <p id="about">Beyonce Knowles is a product of Houston, Texas. She started her career as the lead singer of the girl group Destiny's Child. She then went on to have what is arguably one of the best solo careers in the history of music. She has performed for hundreds of thousands of fans around the world, including the President of the United States.</p>

    <h2>Summer of 23</h2>
    <p>The summer of 2023 brought us the record breaking Renaissance tour. The tour hit 39 cities, entertained nearly 3 million fans, and earned over a half billion dollars (take that Swifties). I personally witnessed this whale of a performance in Tampa, FL which lasted nearly 3 hours. The stadium had an energy that I had never felt before. The atmosphere was electric and Beyonce did not disappoint.</p>
